        The course DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization, taught by Professor Xiaoyi Yang at Northeastern University, 
        is an invaluable class that integrates design thinking, programming, and data storytelling. 
        Throughout the semester, we learned how to create a wide variety of visualizations—from simple bar and scatter plots to complex 
        interactive dashboards—using modern visualization libraries and tools. We also gained hands-on experience with GitHub 
        for version control, allowing us to collaborate efficiently and maintain clean, organized workflows for our projects.

        In addition to mastering visualization techniques, 
        the course introduced us to the full stack of web development, 
        including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which gave us the ability to 
        design and deploy interactive, data-driven web applications. 
        One of the most exciting parts of the course was the final project, 
        where we were tasked with building a complete website that could generate 
        and display visualizations based on user data. This project combined everything 
        we learned—data processing, coding, user interface design, and communication—into one cohesive experience.

        Under Professor Yang’s guidance, we developed not just technical 
        skills but also an appreciation for the art and ethics of data communication. 
        DS 4200 ultimately prepared us to transform raw data into meaningful, engaging, 
        and visually compelling stories that can inform decisions and inspire 
        action in any professional field.
