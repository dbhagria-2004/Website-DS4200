        <h2>Course Projects and Weekly Work</h2>
        <p>
            Over the course of DS 4200, I had the opportunity to explore a wide variety of visualization and design concepts, 
            ranging from data cleaning and preprocessing to creating fully interactive dashboards. Each week brought a new challenge— 
            from learning D3.js and understanding its data-binding mechanism to exploring advanced layouts such as choropleth maps 
            and network visualizations.
        </p>

        <p>
            These projects allowed me to experiment with color theory, typography, and storytelling to convey insights effectively. 
            Beyond the technical aspects, I also learned how design choices influence perception and interpretation of data. 
            Working collaboratively through GitHub, I gained experience managing repositories, handling pull requests, and maintaining 
            code consistency throughout team projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below, I’ll continue to add updates to my weekly progress and visualizations that showcase the learning process and creativity 
            involved in building these data-driven stories.
