LINK: https://dbhagria-2004.github.io/Website-DS4200/index.html

This website was created as part of **DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization** at **Northeastern University**, taught by **Professor Xiaoyi Yang**.

##  Project Goal
The goal of this project is to design a simple, informative website that replaces the traditional course syllabus by providing:
- A brief introduction to the course and its objectives  
- Weekly summaries of topics covered and project milestones  
- Contact information for anyone who wishes to connect or learn more  

The website highlights key skills developed throughout the course, including **data visualization**, **web development**, and **data storytelling**.

##  Website Structure
- **Home Page (`index.html`)** – Introduction to the course and overview of its goals  
- **Weekly Work Page (`page.html`)** – Week-by-week breakdown of lectures, assignments, and projects  
- **Contact Section** – Template for email, GitHub, and LinkedIn links  

## Styling
The site uses **custom CSS** for layout, color, and typography customization to keep the design simple and readable while maintaining a cohesive visual identity.

##  Deployment
The website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
Make sure all links, images, and navigation paths are working correctly before publishing.
